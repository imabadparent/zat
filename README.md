# zat
A cat clone written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org)

This project aims to be fully compliant with the POSIX standard for the cat utility.

## Planned Features
I make no guarantee that these will be added, but they are things I would like to implement
when given the time.

- Syntax highlighting a la (bat)[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat]
- Integration with git
